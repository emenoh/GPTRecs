# GPTRecs
Narrow Recommendation Engine using GPT

OpenAI and other LLMs provide great inferencing capabilities. GPTRecs will build off this capability to implement a narrowly scoped recommendation API.

The end results will be a JSON collection matching the desired recommendation parameters for the following queries (TBD):

- profiles like this one
  - that match a search string
  - that match filter criteria
- documents like this one
  - that match a search string
  - that match filter criteria
